check ready list for highest priority, run that thread

-Thread is (re) added to ready list
-Thread priority is set (changed)
-Thread yields or blocks
-Thread priority is donated
---------------------------------------

use list_max and comparator function


-If list of threads are waiting on a lock/semaphore, 
  Return highest priority one first

--------------------------------------
Implement

thread_set_priority()
->change thread's priority

ready_get_priority()
->if(!donating)
    return thread's priority
  else
    return donor with highest_get_priority_value

-------------------------------------
Donating

create list for keeping track of donating priority
-need to add in this feature in lock_acquire() and lock_release()
